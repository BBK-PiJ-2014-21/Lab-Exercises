## Day Four

### 1. Scope

Look at the following code (with line numbers for clarity) and say where each of the following variables is visible:
i, j, newSize, size.
```
01  class UnitMatrix {
02      int size;
03
04      void setSize(int newSize) {
05          this.size = newSize;
06      }
07
08      void print() {
09          for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
10              for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
11                  if (i == j) {
12                      println("1 ");
13                  } else {
14                      println("0 ");
15                  }
16              }
17              println ""
18          }
19      }
20  }
```

*variable `i` is visible within the block 09-18;
variable `j` is visible within the block 10-16;
parameter `newSize` is visible within the block 04-06 (i.e. inside the method `setSize(int)`;
variable `size` is visible in the whole class (as it is an instance variable);*  

### 2. Pointer, arrows...

#### 2.1    a)
Take the example code from the notes:
```
    class Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    }
    // This method increments the int by 1 and
    // moves the point to the right
    void increment(Point point, int n) {
        n = n + 1;
        point.x = point.x + 1;
        point = null;
        println " At the end of the method..."
        println " The integer is " + n;
        println " The point is " + point;
    }
    // Program execution starts here
    Point myPoint = new Point();
    myPoint.x = 0;
    myPoint.y = 0;
    int myInt = 0;
    println "The integer is now " + myInt;
    println "The point is now " + myPoint.x + "," + myPoint.y;
    println "Calling method increment(Point, int)..."
    increment(myPoint, myInt);
    println "The integer is now " + myInt;
    println "The point is now " + myPoint.x + "," + myPoint.y;
```
Write detailed diagrams that show what variables are there in the “stack” and what objects they point to in
the “heap” (if they are complex types).

#### 2.2    b)
Now do the same for this example code from Day 3:
```
    class Person {
        int age;
        String name;
        Person father;
        Person mother;
    }
    Person john = new Person();
    john.name = "John Smith";
    john.age = 35;
    Person mary = new Person();
    mary.name = "Mary Smith";
    mary.age = 32;
    Person student = new Person();
    student.name = "John Smith, Jr.";
    student.age = 5;
    student.father = john
    student.mother = mary
    println "TEACHER: How old are you, " + student.name + "?"
    println "LITTLE JOHN: I am " + student.age + " years old, sir.";
    println "TEACHER: Who is your mother?"
    println "LITTLE JOHN: " + student.mother.name + ", sir.";
```

### 3. A bit more practice with doubles

Write a program that asks the user for the total amount borrowed for a mortgage, the number of years to pay it
back, and the interest rate (in this exercise, we assume it is a fixed rate). The program can then calculate how
much must be paid at the end
```
t = c ·(1 + r/100)
```
where *t* is the total, *c* is the cost, and *r* is the rate as a percentage. The program should print:
  * The total amount to be paid
  * The money to be paid every year
  * The number of years before the interest is paid and only the initial capital remains
    
Write a method to calculate each piece of data.

(*created class [Mortgage] [1] and script [aBitMorePracticeWithDoubles.groovy] [2]*)

### 4. Binary and decimal

Create a program in which you define the following methods:
  * **binary2decimal(String)**: takes from the user a binary number (with digits 0 and 1) and returns the corresponding
  number in decimal (base-10, with digits between 0 and 9). Hint: in the same way that you know that
  35 = 3 · 101 + 5 · 100, you can find that 100011 = 1 · 25 + 1 · 21 + 1 · 20.
  * **decimal2binary(int)**: the opposite of the previous one: takes a decimal number and returns the corresponding
  binary number. Hint: instead of multiplying by 2, you will need to divide by two this time.

The program must offer a menu to the user with two options. The first one takes a binary number from the
user and returns the corresponding decimal number. The second one does the opposite: takes a decimal number
and returns a binary number. The program should use the methods defined.

(*created script [binaryAndDecimal.groovy] [3]*)

### 5. Binary and Hexadecimal (*)

Binary numbers can be quite long. A 32-bit memory address looks like 1001 0101 0110 1010 1011 0010 1001 1010, 
which is difficult to handle. That is why memory addresses and other binary numbers are usually written as
hexadecimal numbers. An hexadecimal number is a base-16 number, with digits between 0 and f (f is equivalent to
decimal 15, e is equivalent to decimal 14, and so on). An hexadecimal number is equivalent to a four-digit binary
number, which makes them quite compact. The former address reads 956ab29a, which is easier to read and write.
To prevent confusion with decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers are usually prefixed by “0x”, as in 0x95 (which
is 149) or 0xff (which is 255).
Write a program that takes a String. The string can be a decimal or a hexadecimal number (starting by “0x”).
Your program must recognise the number as what it is and convert it to the other base. Use two methods for
conversion as in the former exercise.

(*created script [binaryAndHexadecimal.groovy] [4]*)

### 6. More on points

Write a program in which you create and use a class called Point, with two fields of type double (e.g. x, y) and the
following methods:
  * **distanceTo(Point)**: calculates the distance to another point.
  * **distanceToOrigin()**: calculates the distance to the origin. Implement it by calling the first method.
  * **moveTo(double x, double y)**: changes the coordinates of this point to be the given parameters x and y.
  * **moveTo(Point)**: changes the coordinates of this point to move where the given point is.
  * **clone()**: returns a copy of the current point with the same coordinates.
  * **opposite()**: returns a copy of the current point with the coordinates multiplied by −1.

Two methods in a class can have the same name (identifier) as long as their parameters are different. This is
called *method overloading* and we will see more of that in the future.

(*created class [Point] [5], script [moreOnPoints.groovy] [6] to be implemented*)

### 7. Integer

Create your own version of boxed `int`! Create a class Integer2 with only one field (`int value`) and the following
methods:
  * **getValue()**: returns the value of this number as an int, a getter.
  * **setValue(int)**: a setter.
  * **isEven()**: returns true if the number is even, false otherwise.
  * **isOdd()**: the opposite.
  * **prettyPrint()**: prints the value of the integer on the screen.
  * **toString()**: returns a String equivalent to the number.

Check that it works by using the following program:
```
    Integer2 i2 = new Integer2();
    print "Enter a number: ";
    String str = System.console().readLine();
    int i = Integer.parseInt(str);
    i2.setValue(i);
    print "The number you entered is "
    if (i2.isEven()) {
    println "even.";
    } else if (i2.isOdd()) {
    println "odd.";
    } else {
    println "undefined!! Your code is buggy!";
    }
    int parsedInt = Integer.parseInt(i2.toString());
    if (parsedInt == i2.getValue()) {
    println("Your toString() method seems to work fine.");
    }
```
