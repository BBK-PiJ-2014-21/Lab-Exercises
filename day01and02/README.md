## Day One and Two

### 1. Ternary operator

```
Read the following code and, without executing it first, explain what it does.
	
	int currentYear = 2012
	print "When were you born (year)?"
	String str = System.console().readLine();
	int birthYear = Integer.parseInt(str);
	int ageAprox = currentYear - birthYear;
	String result = (ageAprox > 17) ? "" : "not "
	println "It seems you are " + result + "an adult."

Hint: look at section “The Ternary Operator”.
```
	
This piece of code will ask the user to enter the year of birth,
then it will compute the approximate age in 2012 (without considering the month).
If the result is less or equal to `17`, it will print `It seems you are not an adult.`, 
otherwise it will print `It seems you are an adult.`

### 2. Ende Homage

Is there anything wrong with the following piece of code (hint: yes)? What does it do?

		int i = 10
		while (i < 5) {
			i++;
		println i
		}
	
This piece of code will **not** execute anything. It will just assign the value `10` to the variable `int`;
being `10` greater than `5` the while loop will never start.

### 3. Yet another loop

```
What does the following piece of code do?
	String str = System.console().readLine()
	int i = Integer.parseInt(str)
	while (i < 10) {
		i++;
		str = System.console().readLine()
		int j = Integer.parseInt(str)
		if (j == 0) {
			break;
		} else if (j != 1) {
			println j;
		}
	}
	println "finished"

Hint: the reserved word break exits the current loop.
```

This piece of code will take a number `n` as input: if this is larger or equal to `10`,
it will print `finished`; otherwise it will ask for *10-n* times for another number as input:
if this is equal to `0` it will stop the loop and print `finished`;
otherwise it will print the new number (unless this is equal to `1`) until the (*10-n*)th time,
after that it will go out of the loop and print `finished`.

### 4. Prime numbers

Write a program that asks a number from the user, then says whether the number is prime or not. 
Remember that a number that is divisible by any number apart from 1 and itself is prime.
You can use the modulo operator (if **a%b** is zero, then **a** is divisible by **b**).
 
(*created script* [primeNumbers.groovy] [1])

### 5. Multiplication

Write a program that requests two numbers from the user and then outputs its product. 
You cannot use the `*` operator.

(*created script* [multiplication.groovy] [2])

### 6. Division

Write a program that requests two numbers from the user and then outputs the quotient and the remainder,
e.g. if the user enters 7 and 3, your program should output something like "7 divided by 3 is 2, remainder 1".
You cannot use the `/` or `%` operators.

(*created script* [division.groovy] [3])

### 7. Naive sorting

Write a program that reads three numbers and prints them in order, from lowest to highest.

(*created script* [naiveSorting.groovy] [4])

### 8. Maximising

Write a program that read a (arbitrary long) sequence of positive numbers. The sequence is ended when the users
enters `-1`. At that point, the program must output the highest number in the sequence.

(*created script* [maximising.groovy] [5])

### 9. Going Up!

Read an arbitrary long sequence of positive numbers from the user, until `-1` is entered. At that point, 
print "Yes" if the numbers were consecutive and increasing and "No" otherwise.
Sequences "1,2,3,4,-1" and "5,6,7,8,9,10,11,-1" should output "Yes", but "2,3,5,6,7,-1", "10,9,8,7,-1", 
and "1,1,2,3,4,5-1" should output "No".

(*created script* [goingUp.groovy] [6])

### 10. You said high, I said low...

Modify your former program so that it outputs "Yes" when the numbers are consecutive, regardless of whether
they go up or down. For example, both "2,3,4,5,6,-1" and "10,9,8,7-1" should now result in "Yes".

(*created script* [youSaidHighIsaidLow.groovy] [7])

### 11. Poker hands (*)

Read five cards from the user. For each card, read the rank (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K) and the suit 
("spades", "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs"). Each of the five cards must be valid before accepting the next one. 
Once the program has the five cards, it should tell the user what is the best hand she has got, 
as per the following list (from best to worst):

 **Straight flush:** all cards are of the same suite and their ranks are consecutive.
 					note that they are probably not ordered as they were entered.
 **Poker:** four of the five cards have the same rank.
 **Full House:** three of a kind plus two of a kind.
 **Flush:** all cards share the same suit, but are not consecutive.
 **Straight:** all cards are consecutive, but not of the same suit.
 **Three of a kind:** three of the five cards have the same rank.
 **Two pairs:** two pairs (see below).
 **Pair:** two of the five cards have the same rank.
 **Nothing:** any other situation.

If you ever launch an online poker business, this could be one (very small) piece of it.

(*created script* [pokerHands.groovy] [8])

### 12. Number piramids

Write a program that output a number piramid like the one below.

	1
	22
	333
	4444
	55555
	666666
	7777777
	\ldots

(*created script* [numberPiramids.groovy] [9])

### 13. All the primes up to 1,000 (*)

Write a program that prints on screen all prime numbers up to 1,000.

(*created script* [allThePrimesUpTo1000.groovy] [10])

### 14. Up to 1,000 primes (*)

Modify the program that you wrote for the former exercise so that it writes on screen the first 1,000 primes.

(*created script* [upTo1000primes.groovy] [11])

### 15. Guess my number (*)

Write a program that thinks of a random number between 0 and 1000, and then lets the user try to guess it. 
For every guess, the computer says whether the guess is correct, or too low, or too high. 
When the user finds the number, the computer will tell how many guesses were needed. 
The output could be similar to the following example:
 
	Try to guess my number!
	Tell me a number: 2
	No! My number is higher.
	Tell me a number: 800
    No! My number is lower.
	Tell me a number: 500
	No! My number is lower.
	Tell me a number: 350
	No! My number is higher.
	Tell me a number: 376
	CORRECT!
	You needed 5 guesses.
	
 (Hint: to get a random number between 0 and 1000, use the following line:)
	`int numberToGuess = Math.abs(1000 * Math.random())`
	
(*created script* [guessMyNumber.groovy] [12])

### 16. Rock, Paper, Scissors (*)

Write a program that reads 2 characters from either the keyboard or a file. 
The characters are either PP, PR, PS, RP, RR, RS, SP, or SS. 
They correspond to the selections made by 2 players playing the game of rock-paper-scissors. 
 Make the program accept inputs until one player's score is more than 3 points ahead of the other.
 Hint: remember that you can use .substring() to get the elements of a String.

(*created script* [rockPaperScissors.groovy] [13])

### 17. Optimus Prime (**)

Write a program that reads an integer number from the user, and then outputs the closest prime number.
If there are two prime numbers at the same distance, it should output both. 
For instance, if the user enters 5116, the output should be 5113 *and* 5119.

(*created script* [optimusPrime.groovy] [14])

### 18. π (**)

Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, can be computed by adding the following terms:

`π = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ...`

Create a program that asks the user for a number n and then calculates n of this infinite sum. 
How many terms do you need to get the first three digits right (3.14)?
How many for the first 10 digits (3.13149265358... ...)?
